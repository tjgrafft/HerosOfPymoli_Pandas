# Three trends I noticed after doing this assignment:
1) A large majority of the players of Heroes Of Pymoli are Male and between the ages of 20-24. 
2) A large majority of the microtransactions in the game are made by the same demographic (Male and aged 20-24). Perhaps this is because it is around the age that people become independent and get their own credit cards and income from jobs?
3) While ages 20-24 are the aged group with the highest total purchase value, the 10-15 year olds actually have a higher purchase count, which was surprising. 

I found this homework really challenging and fun. I have a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to group the Item ID and Item Name because they were strings and not floats/ints, which didn't allow me to run a .agg function on multiple groupby columns--so I'll have to stay after class and get help with that from a TA or Bob, as I don't remember going over that in class much.
